# OCI Conformance

The OCI Conformance Working Group operates under the aegis of OCI.
The charter of the working group is to define the process around certifying
OCI conformance.

The goal for the group is to create a software conformance program that any OCI implementation can use to demonstrate that they are conformant and interoperable.

# Submitting Conformance Results
